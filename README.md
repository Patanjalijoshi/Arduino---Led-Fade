# Arduino---Led-Fade
In this project the led brightness will be varied to create a fading effect

## LED Fade
This a basic experiment in which an led is connected to an arduino and the brightness is increased and decreased to create a fading effect.



### Components used:
* Arduino Mega 2560 (The code will be compatable with the Arduino uno as well)
* LED 
* 220 ohm resistor
